# ECE-202-Miniproject-3
Write a Matlab script for the finite-difference analysis of a coaxial cable of rectangular crosssection, as seen in the figure (conductors are shown in gray). Use the iterative method
described in lecture and in textbook section 2.11.
Assume that ax = 2 cm, ay = 1 cm, bx = 4 cm, bly = 1
cm, bhy = 1.5 cm, Va = 1 V, and Vb = -1 V. Use
tolerance of the potential residual Î´V = 1*10-4 V, and
grid spacing d = 0.1 cm. (a) Determine and plot (as
2D color or 3D surface plot) distribution of the
potential in the space between conductors. (b)
Determine and plot (as a 2D quiver plot) electric
field intensity in the space between conductors. (c)
Determine and plot (as 1D curves) surface charge
density on one horizontal surface of the inner
conductor, and one horizontal surface of the outer
conductor.
